Key Value storage for Browser, Node.js, In-Memory.

It is a monorepo for key-value storage.

## Motivation

I want to get universal storage library that works on Browser, Node.js, etc.
Previously, I've created [localstorage-ponyfill](https://github.com/azu/localstorage-ponyfill) for this purpose

However, [Window.localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) does not work on [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) or [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)

`@kvs/*` packages provide async storage API and resolve this issue.

## Packages

- Universal
    - [@kvs/env](./packages/env): Use suitable storage for platform
    - Use IndexedDB for Browser, and Use node-localstorage for Node.js
- Browser
    - [@kvs/indexeddb](./packages/indexeddb): Use IndexedDB
        - For WebWorker and ServiceWorker
    - [@kvs/localstorage](./packages/localstorage): Use LocalStorage
        - For Browser
- Node.js
    - [@kvs/node-localstorage](./packages/node-localstorage): Use [node-localstorage](https://github.com/lmaccherone/node-localstorage)
        - For Node.js
- In-Memory
    - [@kvs/memorystorage](./packages/memorystorage): In-Memory Storage
        - For debug

If you want to custom implementation, please test with [@kvs/common-test-case](./packages/common-test-case).
